# Home Service Platform
### I've created a platform where workers and clients can find each other and collaborate.

The application has two views:
1. The Client View
   - The client has a user friendly and intuitive flow for finding a worker to help him with his needs.
   - It's a three step process:
      -  1. Select the service you need
         2. Select the day when you need the job to be done
         3. Choose the worker from a list of available workers near you, that are specialized in your needed service

2. The Worker View
   - Worker have three important functionalities:
       -  1. Create a good looking profile with the services that he provides and all necessary informations.
          2. Add his availability in the calendar.
          3. Track and successfully complete his jobs to get good reviews.
